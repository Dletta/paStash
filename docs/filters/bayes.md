Bayes filter
---

Status : experimental plugin.

The [bayes](https://github.com/ttezel/bayes) filter takes a key value from a stream and returns a classification based on the loaded JSON definitions.
Classifier JSON must be provided on the side, or generated by a parallel writing paStash pipeline.

Example: classify a message

Config using logstash format:
````
filter{
 if [type] == 2 {
  gun_write{
    source_field => message
    destination_field => classification
    json_file => '/path/to/bayes_snapshot.json'
  }
 }
}
````

Parameters:

* ``source_field``: which data field to pass Bayes.
* ``target_field``: target field to inject with returned Bayes value.
* ``json_file``: Bayes JSON snapshot with classifications.
